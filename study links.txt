1. DataCamp - Python, R, SQL. Very well structured courses with hands-on exercises. Hugo Bowne-Anderson’s courses on Python are something that I’ve gained a lot from personally.

2. David Langer’s Series on YouTube-R. I personally started learning R through this video series. David covers everything from basics to advanced using some publicly available data sets.

3. StatQuest by Joshua Starmer- One stop solution for all Statistical concepts. Multiple video series available from basics to advanced.

4. ML by Andrew Ng - The course is available on #Coursera and covers everything for your Machine Learning journey.

5. Machine Learning A-Z - Course available on Udemy and the name says it all.

For SQL, w3schools usually has everything that I need. David also has an active series on SQL which might come in handy.s
